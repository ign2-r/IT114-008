<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I picked the coin toss command. To implement it, I added an if<br>statement to the processCommand method, which generated a random double from 0.0 to<br>1.0. Values equal to over 0.5 were considered heads, while everything else was<br>considered tails, allowing for a 50/50 chance at either one. Then, the results<br>were broadcasted using the user&#39;s ID that used the command and what they<br>landed on.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I picked the message shuffle command. It&#39;s kinda janky but I used the<br>startsWith() replace() methods to tell whether the command is being used, then removes<br>the command from the message. Then I turned the remaining message into a<br>string, into an arraylist, shuffled it around into a new arraylist, then turned<br>it back to a string which is then broadcasted.<br></p><br></td></tr>
